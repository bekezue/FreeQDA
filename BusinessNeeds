funding is a major need at this time. i would utilize additional funding to invest in an industry mentor or coach. by obtaining a mentor, i would get the much-needed advice and help to implement and strategize the development of my services, brand, and platform. secondly, i would invest in marketing and communications development. by doing this i would be able to create a signature look, website, and user interface that would be tailored to my specific audience, and present a polished, cohesive business to the public. through the mentor and marketing development, i hope to increase my revenue, and be more accessible so other potential clients may be able to reach me with ease.
